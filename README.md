🇫🇷🇬🇧 Franglais NLP Research
French ↔ English Cross-Lingual Semantic Analysis
📌 Overview
This project explores cross-lingual natural language processing (NLP) between French, English, and mixed “Franglais” text.
The goal is to study how modern NLP techniques handle code-switching, semantic similarity, and multilingual understanding.
The project demonstrates a complete NLP pipeline, from preprocessing and embeddings to classification and evaluation, using academic and everyday text examples.
🎯 Objectives
Build a clean bilingual and code-switched dataset
Perform minimal but effective preprocessing
Generate multilingual sentence embeddings using Sentence-BERT
Train a classifier to detect:
English (en)
French (fr)
Mixed / Franglais (mix)
Evaluate model performance and analyze limitations
Provide a solid foundation for future research (topic modeling, dashboards)
🧠 Techniques & Tools
Python
Sentence-BERT (multilingual embeddings)
scikit-learn (Random Forest classifier)
spaCy (language support)
NumPy & Pandas
Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
